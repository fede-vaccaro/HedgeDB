     * It inherits from `fs::file` to manage the underlying file descriptor.

     * Key Features:
     * - **Immutability:** Once created, the file content is generally not modified (except potentially for experimental in-place updates).
     * - **Key uniqueness:** Each key appears at most once in the index.
     *                       For updating or removing an entry, it should be done in the mem_index and then flushed/merged to create a new sorted_index file.
     * - **Sorted Keys:** Entries (`index_entry_t`) within the file are sorted by key.
     * - **Meta-Index:** Contains an in-memory meta-index for efficient page lookups.
     * - **Optional In-Memory Index:** Can load the entire main index into memory (`_index`) for faster lookups if configured, or load pages on demand.
     * - **Asynchronous Lookups:** Provides `lookup_async` using `io_executor` and `liburing` for high performance.
